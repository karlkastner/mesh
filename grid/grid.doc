lumping (fitting) of spatio-temporal data into a regular grid

supports also a 1D/2D spatial grid and function for time

allows for processing of large data sets with lower memory consumption and run time

intended for ADCP data processing

It is recommened to use the SparseMesh rather than grid, as grid-cells
with few samples in Grid become ill conditioned

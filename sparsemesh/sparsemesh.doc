lumping and interpolation of spatio-temporal data into a "mesh" that is spaced
optimally for the local density of sample points

allows for processing of large data sets with lower memory consumption and run time

intended for ADCP data processing

Overcomes the limitation of gridding, where some grid cells can have an insufficient
number of samples
